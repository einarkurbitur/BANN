**Reading phase**

* The period at the beginning of a session where the nodes read their instructions.


**Training phase**

* the period betefore a set where creators and evaluators examine and learn from the training data. The lenght of the training phase is 10 seconds multiplied by the amount of files in the training set.


**Pre-set-preparation**

* A period before a set where the nodes gather extra data to use in the next round. This can be used for gathering fonts, imagery, setting up color palettes etc. from the internet or other people.


**Set**

**Progress Tracking**

* A 1 minute period where the progress tracker does their job.


**Node**

**Data Sorter**

* Sorts the data by splitting it down into training data for the creators. The data sorter also normalizes the output data from the creators and mixes it with existing data that then goes to the Evaluator.


**Creator**

* Creates new imagery based on the training data. This is the main output of the network. Their goal is to improve and fool the Evaluator.


**Evaluator**
