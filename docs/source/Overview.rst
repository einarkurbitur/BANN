#. The network is gathered and the controller selects what the network will create
#. The data sorter starts gathering data and splitting it into appropriate folders
#. Reading phase starts.
#. Training phase starts.
#. Pre-Set preparation starts.
#. Set 1 starts, with rounds equal to the amount of creator nodes in the network.
#. After the set the Data sorter gathers the output from the creators, adds an equal amount of data from existing source and makes all the files the same size and format. The Data sorter then gives his data to the Evaluator
#. Evaluating
#. Progress Tracking
#. Step 5 - 9 is then repeated as often as desired.
